# KeymastersKeepGames
A collection of game integrations maintained by Seafo for Keymaster's Keep.
Keymaster's Keep can be found here: https://github.com/SerpentAI/Archipelago/releases?q=keymaster%27s+keep



The Mega Man integrations are all designed with the assumption of being played with a new game.

Pokemon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum was designed with the assumption of being played in the postgame, after all story events have been completed.
